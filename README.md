# Converting a text file to a CSV file

Before trying to run any of the code make sure you have the following packages and read about the script:

*If you do not have the glob package here is the python3 command to install it:*
> ``` pip3 install glob3 ```


About the script
-
- This script simply will convert a .txt file to a CSV file.  You will be prompted to clarify if you want to convert a single file or multiple.  All you have to do is enter '1' for multiple files and '2' for just one.  
- Next, you will be asked if you are in the target directory or not. If the script is in the same directory as the file(s) you wish to convert, you can simply enter 'n' or 'N'. Otherwise, you have to specify the path to the directory with the .txt file(s) you wish to convert. 
- If you're converting multiple files, your work here is done.  
- If you're just converting one file you will be asked to specify the exact file name (e.g. example.txt), so the script does not go about trying to convert every .txt file to a CSV.

To run
-

```
python3 txt_to_csv.py

Follow prompts in terminal
```
